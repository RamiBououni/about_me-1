      <p>My name is Quinn.  I'm a former biochemist and now an aspiring developer. I have lived and did bio-related research in three different countries which include China, Canada and the US.
       I'm always facinated by the different perspective from diffrent people coming from different backgrounds. This unique experience also let me have an open mind when doing research and wring codes!
     I'm now learning coding at CodeFellows and I'm having lots of fun!

     <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>After I finished my undergraduate and master programs in China, I went to Canana and earned my PhD in biochemistry.  Although I was productive and my resume looks pretty impressive with all the publications and patent, I don't see a  meaningful career path in
       biology. Luckly, I found my passion in computer science after leaving academia and entered the apprenticeship program. I'm excited about the new career.
